INSIGHTS:
* The table will clearly show which Instagram campaigns, ending after January 2024 and with a spend over $1000, had the highest and lowest click-to-conversion ratios.
* This allows for a direct comparison of campaign effectiveness in terms of converting clicks into actual conversions.
*  Campaigns with significantly higher click-to-conversion ratios may indicate more effective targeting or ad creative.
* Conversely, campaigns with low ratios might suggest areas for improvement in ad targeting, messaging, or landing page optimization.
